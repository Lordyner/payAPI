## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## My process

I started by analyzing the different design and look for things that I didn't know how to handle. I feel at ease with everything, except those circle background image and how to handle them responsivly. So I decided to keep it for the end.

I created my next.js project from a template that I developped and added the different colors, font-size and fields elements. Then I started the first page, section by section, mobile to desktop and top to bottom.

After I did the same for the others pages : pricing, about, contact. Next I added the circle background image, struggle with it, ask help in the discord.

Finally I did a final review and some tweaking on padding and checked that everything was alright.
